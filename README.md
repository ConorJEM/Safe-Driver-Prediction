# Safe-Driver-Prediction
A project I completed as part of a university module on machine learning. The project is based of a Kaggle competition that can be found at https://www.kaggle.com/c/porto-seguro-safe-driver-prediction/overview/evaluation

My model is an XGBoost Classifier, with tuned hyper-parameters. Attached is a word-file with a report on my project.
